            I am Ruoceng Xu (but you can call me Oliver), a Year 4 undergraduate student
            in Mathematics at Imperial College London. My interest in mathematics is mainly in how
            algebraically formalized geometry interacts with differential geometry. I would be happy
            to do research in geometric group theory, gauge theory, global differential geometry, or
            any other fields that intersect geometry with intriguing analytical approaches.

        <h2>Current Work</h2>
        <p>
          I am currently working on my MRes and a note on differential topology. My undergraduate
          final project is about connecting variety and circle-manifold rings in an ambitious goal:
          it aims to define the concurrency variety of <em>Q[x]</em> from scratch. 
        </p>
        <p>
          I’m also keenly interested in global differential geometry, so I have been taking
          dedicated notes as I progress through advanced topics. I intend to make these notes
          accessible as a small resource for anyone with Year 2 level or beyond in mathematics.
